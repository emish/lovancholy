Friendlies with the Kids
========================

Today is another day of friendly matches, this time against the
students and friends of our Kyoto tour guide, Hyodo, whom I continue to call
'Captain'. He has brought with him a memory booklet of Osaka and Kyoto,
filled with pictures and information on the places we have visited. Most
importantly, however, he has included the poems I insisted on having
from Sansa's home in Kyoto, a group of stanzas giving humorous and
eloquent advice on the game of Go. Due to time travel, I have posted these
in a previous entry.

Kids playing Go

In addition to Captain's players, we are also joined by kindergarten
and elementary school kids. Since I am a low Kyu player, I pair up
against kindergarten children. Make no mistake, these five and seven
year olds have great fighting spirit. I play against a very shy 8k
little boy, and a lively 25k little girl. My last opponent before
lunch is Kakeru, a cute little boy who loves to laugh. Over lunch, we
talk with the other members about our opponents: Jack was beaten by a
six year old 5 kyu, and Jan played a five year old 2 Dan. I was
flabbergasted to discover five year olds 2 Dans existed, no less
amongst today's guests!

A Gift
------

After we return from lunch, we are all gifted a very beautiful present
for playing today, a bunch of tiny origami cranes. It looks like
making them took forever. We also get a mini origami set with
instructions attached.

An Exciting Evening
===================

After a busy day of matches, we take a break and rest for a bit, only
a few games are being played now. Suddenly, six boys and six girls are
idly sitting around the tatami mats, and a group match is called. If
the boys team loses, we buy the girls ice cream, and if we win, we get
beer. It's on!

The boys win, and get a free beer each from the girls. Now
that that's over, Musa decides we should play Rengo, I'm called over,
and we begin a 3 v 3 team match. After just twenty moves the result is
quite interesting.

While playing, Michael shows us another Go camp, or more appropriately
Go retreat, that takes place in British Columbia. It's run by the
Hollyhock institute, a group that runs a bunch of themed retreats,
which I will plan to check out. This year apparently, they ran the Go
retreat and Tantric sex retreat simultaneously, and Go members heard
strange noises in the cabins.

Meanwhile, Hyodo is intensely playing Go online.

Sushi for Dinner
================

The college girls stuck around for the night, after playing the team
match, so we all decide to get dinner. A group of some twenty-five Go
players march down the streets, scouring for food. We decide that
sushi will be simplest, but they don't have enough room for us on this
Sunday night. Kim-San and a few others will get the food, while the
rest of us return to the TTS center where we will eat. A random guy
with long white hair plays harmonica in the street while we wait for
our food. He's not very good.

The Sumo ring has now turned into a sushi buffet, and with the rules
presented on day one about Sumo ring sanctity, I can't help but think
how insulted the Sumo staff (whoever they are) would be with this
sushi desecration.
