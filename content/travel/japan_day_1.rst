Morning After 
=============

It's now 4:40am, and the city is fast asleep except for the McDonald's
I found. Skimpy skirted girls are eating their after-party meals,
while I have only just woken up. Clearly the jet lag will take some
getting used to. I take a walk through the deserted town after eating
my burger, then I head back to the hotel to sleep some more.

Second Wind 
===========

At 9:30 I awoke again, the quarter pounder at 5am having subsided my
terrible hunger. The Japanese hotel bathrooms are supposedly very
standardized, with the automatic toilet bidet and shower. I have
learned to use these and, while it is not as familiar or satisfying as
the Arabian 'shafata', it is just as effective. I am pleased with it,
and it's certainly better than just toilet paper. Europeans are
clearly missing this.

David and I proceeded to the go camp registration location, to find
the Go camp staff, of whom was Jon, a PhD computer science English
speaker, perfect! What luck. We spoke to him, registered with Li Ting,
and met with Ryo Maeda 6P. They were all very kind, and gave us a gift
fan with our registration papers, to get signed by our favorite
professional players from the Kiin. I hope I can get Go Seigen's in Tokyo
somehow.

With everything set up, I can't wait to play.

I was a little disappointed with the quality of equipment, specifically the
thin stones. Even UPenn's Go Society has better quality stones, and the boards
all seem to be foldable ones. Somebody must not enjoy moving this stuff around.

We took a mesh go board and plastic stones back to the hotel which
they provided, and proceeded to find food for brunch. This brought us
to a cafe serving charcoal roasted coffee, which David wanted to
try. I had an egg sandwich and iced coffee with coffee jelly, the
latter of which was very good.

Subway
======

The subways here are quite fascinating. You figure out your fare on a
map at your source and buy a ticket for that much, then you use your
ticket to go through the entrance gates, as well as the exit gates at your
destination. If you are switching lines and need to buy a new ticket,
you put them both in together at the gates in between! Epic.

A complicated railway, and just the local parts too!

The subway gates, they work both ways.

The perfect shot
================

David's sister gave him a doll to take pictures of. In an attempt to
get an interesting shot, I tried to jump over two meters of water and,
to my dismay, failed and got my shoes all wet. Oh well.

The little doll in the middle of the steps.

To remedy this, I decide to go find my hiking shoes now, since many
train stations in Japan are equipped with shopping
malls. Unfortunately, after 7 floors of woman's wear, I discovered that 
my feet were too big for Japan too. Let's hope I'll be able to find said
shoes before Mt. Fuji.

Extras
======

A woman plays 3DS riding up the escalator.

Looking at more shoes, they are playing a daft punk get lucky
remix. I've noticed that two things so far are universal throughout
cultures: music, and numbers.

Never a dull moment
-------------------

Even when at a cafe for an innocent snack and
coffee, which serves toast, pronounced 'toast-o' by the way, there are long
stretches of tables with complementary iPad minis to use. Also,
libraries filled with manga to borrow while you drink your
coffee. Growing up here would have been fun.

First game
==========

I play my first friendly game against Jon, one of the
supervisors. He's a 3 Dan so even nine stones would not have been enough. He
decides we should play with six, as he is not a fan of white's play in
high-handicap games. I acquiesce, relishing the opportunity to finally
play; I had been itching to all day.

Our game begins normally, but, as in any game with as many stones,
fighting begins quickly as white tries to take back the advantage. He
has me running from the corner, although I could have made life, but I
kept his two groups apart. A ladder he misread in the middle
strengthens my position tremendously. At this moment, we are fighting
for the group at the top left. I should be counting as he helps
incoming travelers to their rooms.

Thirty minutes later, he returned. And I lost.

A few moves before I resign.

Dinner
======

Later that night, David and I walk outside to find some food at the nearby 
shops. In a style akin to Bahrain's street-side vendors, we find a few places
that tickle our fancy. The first is a fried chicken shop, where we learn they 
sell fried chicken after a few minutes of pictionary with the vendors. That was
fun.

The fried chicken stand.

The chicken is served in a bag and eaten with a thick toothpick-stick. 

The chicken was delicious. Following this, we try some octopus balls, not 
what you think, at another stand. They put pieces of octopus inside of these
egg-corn-ball-things. It looks rather good, but trying it, it was rather soggier
than we imagined it would be. I was picturing a firm fried cheeseball sort of 
experience.

The octopus balls being prepared.

The one thing these vendors shared, and every store or restaurant you go to will
show the same quality, is that they are extermely grateful for your patronage. 
On your way out, or after purchasing at a stand, you are showered with gratitude
and thank you's, "Arigato Gosaimashta!" This is quite contrasting with American
attitude, where anyone who serves you food seems to inherently hate you. I like
Japan's culture a thousand-times over America's so far.
