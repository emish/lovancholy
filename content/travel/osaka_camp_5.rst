Friendly matches
================

Today we play against local Insei and Go
students. They are all supposedly much better than we are, and perhaps only a
couple of our camp members can hold their own against the
strongest. All the tables have players on them today, the sumo arena
is bustling with go activity, and will sound like the Kiin for the
next hour or so. The game reviews are bound to be exciting.

I play against a 5k Japanese girl and win effortlessly, another
testament that the rating system here is inflated. Probably because
they actually have pros so this way at least a few amateurs can call
themselves Dan. I finally announce to Li sensei my desire to be
promoted to 5 kyu. As if to punish my eagerness, she immediately
snatches my name tag off my neck and edits the 7k to say 5 in red
pen. Guess there's no going back now.

Walking around the go tables I hear the clocks cry “ju byo” for the
umpteenth time and finally ask Maeda-Sensei what it means. 'Ju' is
ten, and 'byo' is time; so it's just telling you that ten seconds has
passed. And then, after over a year of ignorance, I finally discover
the meaning of “byo yomi”: 'reading time.' There are an amazing number
of female Japanese go players, almost one third of these Insei players
are female.

At lunch I got the chance to speak with Clement, a museum curator from
Singapore who specializes in art. His background is quite
interesting. We go with some others to a local small shop that serves
lunch combos.

A Good Game
-----------

My second game is very exciting, and I'm up against another female
player, Ayako. Upon getting it reviewed, Maeda Sensei shows us many of
our mistakes, including playing moves that were way too small.

More Family Mart Fun
--------------------

Walking through the supermarket, I notice they are selling hentai
manga along with the rest of the manga and magazines. Interesting. I mention
this to David and his witty remark cracks me up, "Well, some members of the 
family want hentai manga."

Go Camping
----------

Back at the camp, Sathya sets up some funky life and death problems
for me to solve, and the fellow Dans stand around almost instructing
me along the way. Did I mention I love this camp? Later, Jaxon
appears and we look at other life and death problems, most notably the
Carpenter's square; can we kill it without Ko? Even Jaxon's Chinese
5 Dan girlfriend, Leaves, is unable to find the answer. Maeda Sensei
walks past and gasps at the sight, exclaiming how intricate and
complex the solutions are.

Laundry Time
============

Tonight I need to launder clothes, so I walk them over to the
laundromat. Now, if anyone had ever used the phrase “hole in the wall”
before, they've never used it like this. Approximately 2 meters by 2 meters, the
laundromat is just a collection of machines and a small
coffee table in the center. The thing about laundry in Japan is, most
people hang their clothes at home, and if they use the laundromat,
they leave and come get it later. Because people in Japan are nice and
they don't steal! Yes! It was difficult to accept this fact, and so I
stayed with my laundry for the whole hour and half regimen. I soon
learned that laundromat's are mosquito hives, due to their high
temperature, and am now the proud owner of some twenty or so mosquito
bites; fantastic.
