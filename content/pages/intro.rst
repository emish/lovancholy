   `An artist presents a painting, a writer a poem; what art can a programmer
   present, but a website?`

   The digital 
   manifestation of the inherent melancholy of two amateur lovers at a great 
   distance.

.. , who must push away their uncertainty of the future in order to
.. start their own lives, yet at the same time, hold on to each other as 
.. tightly as they can. 

.. The inherent melancholy of two people at great distance who are still very
.. much in love and wish to puncture this distance with teleportation.

.. The melancholy of two begginers in love pushed astride by a great distance
.. who must push away their uncertainty of the future in order to start their own
.. lives yet at the same time hold on to each other as tightly as they can.
