* Script: Locations to Map
  
  input: location1, location2 
  
  Where location1 is the location of
  person 1, location2 is the location of person 2.

  Person 1 is female, person 2 is male. Colors on the map will
  symbolize this.

  The output is a geojson file representing the locations, and a line
  between the points. 

  The distance between the points is also output in Miles.

** TODO Line between points is curved
   Use Bezier algorithm to plot a curve, i.e., output an array of points.
