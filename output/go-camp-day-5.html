<h2>Friendlies with the&nbsp;Kids</h2>
<p>Today is another day of friendly matches, this time against the
students and friends of our Kyoto tour guide, Hyodo, whom I continue to call
&#8216;Captain&#8217;. He has brought with him a memory booklet of Osaka and Kyoto,
filled with pictures and information on the places we have visited. Most
importantly, however, he has included the poems I insisted on having
from Sansa&#8217;s home in Kyoto, a group of stanzas giving humorous and
eloquent advice on the game of Go. Due to time travel, I have posted these
in a previous&nbsp;entry.</p>

<p>Kids playing&nbsp;Go</p>
<p>In addition to Captain&#8217;s players, we are also joined by kindergarten
and elementary school kids. Since I am a low Kyu player, I pair up
against kindergarten children. Make no mistake, these five and seven
year olds have great fighting spirit. I play against a very shy 8k
little boy, and a lively 25k little girl. My last opponent before
lunch is Kakeru, a cute little boy who loves to laugh. Over lunch, we
talk with the other members about our opponents: Jack was beaten by a
six year old 5 kyu, and Jan played a five year old 2 Dan. I was
flabbergasted to discover five year olds 2 Dans existed, no less
amongst today&#8217;s&nbsp;guests!</p>

<h3>A&nbsp;Gift</h3>
<p>After we return from lunch, we are all gifted a very beautiful present
for playing today, a bunch of tiny origami cranes. It looks like
making them took forever. We also get a mini origami set with
instructions&nbsp;attached.</p>

<h2>An Exciting&nbsp;Evening</h2>
<p>After a busy day of matches, we take a break and rest for a bit, only
a few games are being played now. Suddenly, six boys and six girls are
idly sitting around the tatami mats, and a group match is called. If
the boys team loses, we buy the girls ice cream, and if we win, we get
beer. It&#8217;s&nbsp;on!</p>

<p>The boys win, and get a free beer each from the girls. Now
that that&#8217;s over, Musa decides we should play Rengo, I&#8217;m called over,
and we begin a 3 v 3 team match. After just twenty moves the result is
quite&nbsp;interesting.</p>

<p>While playing, Michael shows us another Go camp, or more appropriately
Go retreat, that takes place in British Columbia. It&#8217;s run by the
Hollyhock institute, a group that runs a bunch of themed retreats,
which I will plan to check out. This year apparently, they ran the Go
retreat and Tantric sex retreat simultaneously, and Go members heard
strange noises in the&nbsp;cabins.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hyodo is intensely playing Go&nbsp;online.</p>

<h2>Sushi for&nbsp;Dinner</h2>
<p>The college girls stuck around for the night, after playing the team
match, so we all decide to get dinner. A group of some twenty-five Go
players march down the streets, scouring for food. We decide that
sushi will be simplest, but they don&#8217;t have enough room for us on this
Sunday night. Kim-San and a few others will get the food, while the
rest of us return to the <span class="caps">TTS</span> center where we will eat. A random guy
with long white hair plays harmonica in the street while we wait for
our food. He&#8217;s not very&nbsp;good.</p>
<p>The Sumo ring has now turned into a sushi buffet, and with the rules
presented on day one about Sumo ring sanctity, I can&#8217;t help but think
how insulted the Sumo staff (whoever they are) would be with this
sushi&nbsp;desecration.</p>
