<h2>All&nbsp;Aboard</h2>
<p>Today we go to Hiroshima. We are taking a bus to get there; it&#8217;s about
a three hour drive. The drive to Hiroshima is long but calm. After
leaving Osaka city, Japan&#8217;s wondrous landscape reveals itself. Trees
are covering everything, including the mountains both near and
far. Small towns and large towns sit comfortably nestled in between
the peaked&nbsp;giants.</p>
<p>For the first time since arriving here, I&#8217;ve put on my
headphones. It&#8217;s interesting that I&#8217;ve gone over a week without
exclusively - or even passively for that matter - listening to
music. We stop for a ten minute break, and I decide to invest in a
pair of ten dollar sunglasses as the sun is quite bright&nbsp;today.</p>
<p>On the bus ride, I talked to Steve of Sacramento,
he told me about the Cotsen tournament in <span class="caps">LA</span> which is the largest Go
tournament in California. The Jujo tournament, spelled zhiuxo or
something, is also another big Go tournament in&nbsp;California.</p>
<p>Nick opens a box of pocky, and soon the chocolate sticks are dangling
out every mouth like a bus of&nbsp;schoolchildren.</p>
<p>We stop again for lunch, and a bathroom&nbsp;break.</p>

<h2>Innoshima</h2>
<div class="section" id="welcoming-party">
<h3>Welcoming&nbsp;Party</h3>
<p>We arrive at Innoshima, the home town of Shusaku, one of the greatest
Go players, if not the greatest, of all time. The people of Innoshima
greet us with great fanfair, clapping to us as we enter the Shusaku
memorial, as if in a wedding. The mayor is also attending, and is
greeting us with great fondness. He gives us all a speech, describing
the importance of Innoshima as the city that birthed Shusaku, and how
legendary his tale is here. To us Go freaks, this is very&nbsp;exciting.</p>
<img alt="/static/images/DSC_0474.jpg" src="/static/images/DSC_0474.jpg" />
<p>Our welcoming committee at the memorial entrance. So&nbsp;nice!</p>

<p>The mayor of Innoshima gives us a welcoming&nbsp;speech.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-shusaku-exhibits">
<h3>The Shusaku&nbsp;Exhibits</h3>
<p>We are given a tour of the official Shusaku memorial by the caretaker
himself, and provided translation. There are many exhibits on display&nbsp;here.</p>
<img alt="/static/images/DSC_0514.jpg" src="/static/images/DSC_0514.jpg" />
<p>A beautiful stone painting and exhibit adorning Shusaku&#8217;s legendary Ear-Reddening&nbsp;Move.</p>
<img alt="/static/images/DSC_0482.jpg" src="/static/images/DSC_0482.jpg" />
<p>The museum is filled with old kifu and&nbsp;scrolls.</p>
<p>The memorial tells the tale of Shusaku, the most famous Go
player in Japan&#8217;s history. They show us the Go board and stones that
he used to play with his mother, who taught him the game when he was
just four years old. The clamshell stones are so old, they are browning.
At only seven years old, this young boy had
already impressed the royal castle with his skill, and by nine he had
started to regularly take part in castle tournament games. Sadly, he
died of cholera at the age of thirty&nbsp;four.</p>
<img alt="/static/images/DSC_0501.jpg" src="/static/images/DSC_0501.jpg" />
<p>The actual board and stones used by Shusaku himself with his&nbsp;mother.</p>
<p>They show us a memorial of Shusaku&#8217;s house, built to look the same. The
high Dan players will be playing here, with the impressively thick Go&nbsp;equipment.</p>

<div class="section" id="playing-the-locals">
<h3>Playing the&nbsp;Locals</h3>
<p>They start the pairings against the local Go players of Innoshima, and
the Country and names of camp players are called as they are paired with
local Hiroshima players, who are extremely eager to play&nbsp;us.</p>
<p>We each played two or three games, barely making our day&#8217;s
schedule. The hosts thank us for coming, appreciating our Go strength
as we beat their local players 70 to&nbsp;30.</p>
<img alt="/static/images/DSC_0533.jpg" src="/static/images/DSC_0533.jpg" />

</div>
<div class="section" id="shusaku-s-legend">
<h3>Shusaku&#8217;s&nbsp;Legend</h3>
<p>Excited for us, the hosts
explain the the legend of Shusaku&#8217;s tomb: it is said that one who
prays for Shusaku at his gravestone will be granted two stones of
strength. They explain how to properly pray and lay incense in front
of Shusakus grave in order to claim our two stones of&nbsp;strength.</p>
<p>The graveyard is beautiful, filled with sculptures and&nbsp;ornamentals.</p>
<img alt="/static/images/DSC_0555.jpg" src="/static/images/DSC_0555.jpg" />
<p>Everyone lines up to pay respects to Shusaku, and gain two stones of&nbsp;strength.</p>
<p>The town where Shusaku was brought up, Innoshima, reminds me a lot of
my grandfather&#8217;s hometown in the south of Lebanon. Mountainous, and
full of houses with their own private gardens of vegetables. It looks like
a nice, quiet place to spend your&nbsp;days.</p>

<div class="section" id="arrival-to-hiroshima">
<h2>Arrival to&nbsp;Hiroshima</h2>
<p>Our beds here are in a youth hostel, very neat and clean with almost
the same bathroom unit, but sadly it&#8217;s not equipped with a bidet. A
large group of us take off to find a restaurant downtown, and end up
passing through the world peace memorial park. The memorial
itself is quite beautiful, its stone lines up perfectly with
a torch in the distance, and behind that the only remaining building
from before the atomic bomb. The memorial is still active, in that
even today, tonight, it is filled with flowers and offerings to those
souls that were lost in the blast. It&#8217;s incredible to think how right
now, I am walking exactly below where the atomic bomb detonated some
sixty years&nbsp;ago.</p>
<div class="section" id="dinner-and-a-show">
<h3>Dinner and a&nbsp;Show</h3>
<p>The original group of twenty or so splits up unknowlingly as we
venture into the depths of Hiroshima&#8217;s city lights at night. I end up
with Nick and Musa, from Canada, and we eat at a very nice Tapas style
restaurant with tons of little plates filled with delicious food. We
can barely stop ourselves from ordering more. After having our fill,
we decide to pop in to a Karaoke place on the way home. Japanese Karaoke is very famous, and this is my first time. We are ushered into an empty room with a
couple of microphones, a <span class="caps">TV</span>, and a control panel for queueing songs. With
drinks pouring in, the night is young, and we have a great time singing songs
from David Bowie to Avril Lavigne. We are having so much fun, we decide to stay another&nbsp;hour.</p>
<p>The Karaoke hostess comes in and ends our second hour. As we
pay for the sessions downstairs, ready to head home, we look at our watches and
suddenly remember the hostel policy, what the front desk told us
before leaving that night, &#8220;Please return before 1 a.m. as our front
doors will be locked for the night. There are no exceptions to this
rule.&#8221; It&#8217;s 12:39 a.m. &#8220;Shit.&#8221; We spend the next twenty minutes
sprinting for the hostel, running through the peace memorial park like
drunken fools, and make it to the front doors by 12:57 a.m., an
otherwise fourty minute or more&nbsp;walk.</p>
