<h2>Rice for&nbsp;breakfast</h2>
<p>Having breakfast at the hotel today, they have a
much more traditional assortment than the local shops nearby, quote
ironically. Eggs half cooked floating in individual bowls, fish of all
kinds, salads, rice, miso soup, pickled squid, dumplings, fried
chicken. It was worth the 900 Yen markup over the 300 Yen cheaper
breakfasts we had yesterday. Eating alone, I savor the novel&nbsp;meal.</p>

<div class="section" id="league-game-2">
<h2>League Game&nbsp;2</h2>
<p>I played Musa, an Iraqi who lives in Canada. The game progressed well
until I started losing groups. I was white since he was an
8k. Eventually I lost by 11 points. This is not a game I am proud&nbsp;of.</p>
<p>Later, we have our game reviewed by a Nakano 9 Dan professional. For
context, 1P in Japan is roughly equivalent to an 8 Dan amateur, so
this guy is worlds above our levels as mere Kyu players. It was a
great honor to have him show us our mistakes, and also a great&nbsp;embarrassment.</p>

<p>My game against Musa. I play White. For full control: <a class="reference external" href="http://gokifu.com/s/1eqq">http://gokifu.com/s/1eqq</a></p>
<p>Lunch is at the S-Terrace again. Udon noodles and fried chicken. I
wish they had more veggies, but it&#8217;s only 3 dollars for this noodle
bowl so it&#8217;s no surprise. They love friend chicken and breaded pork
here, it&#8217;s in everything unless you get the vegetarian option, but then
you&#8217;re just stuck with fried tofu,&nbsp;meh.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lectures">
<h2>Lectures</h2>
<p>The first lecture was by Ryo Maeda. It was the solution to yesterday&#8217;s
endgame problem. I didn&#8217;t have enough time to solve the homework as I
was still recovering from jet&nbsp;lag.</p>
<p>The next lecture is by Nakano, translated by someone else who is not
John. John&#8217;s skill at translation become quite evident, as Nakano&#8217;s
lecture proceeds at a snails pace, with a lot lost in translation, if
not lost&nbsp;entirely.</p>

<p>Nakano explaining&nbsp;stuff.</p>
<p>Li Ting sets up the magnet board and goes over players&#8217; games in front
of everyone, making it a large teaching session, while the rest of the players
are busy playing teaching games with the other professionals, Nakano and&nbsp;Kim.</p>

<h2>Later&nbsp;on</h2>
<p>I find out there&#8217;s another blog about the Go camp, you can find it
here: <a class="reference external" href="http://osakago.blogspot.de/">http://osakago.blogspot.de/</a></p>
<p>I play against a Frenchman named Christian who has a wife and baby waiting for him at
home. The game ends in a tie, with 44 points each, the first time this
has ever happened to me, and an extremely rare occurence in Go. There was less fanfare than I expected from&nbsp;others.</p>
<p>Around 7pm, I return to the hotel without grabbing dinner, I am not
hungry. Laying on the bed, because there really isn&#8217;t anywhere else to
lay in this tiny room, puts me to sleep in mere minutes. Not much has
happened today, I am still recuperating from&nbsp;travel.</p>
