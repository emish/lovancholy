<h2>Morning&nbsp;After</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s now 4:40am, and the city is fast asleep except for the McDonald&#8217;s
I found. Skimpy skirted girls are eating their after-party meals,
while I have only just woken up. Clearly the jet lag will take some
getting used to. I take a walk through the deserted town after eating
my burger, then I head back to the hotel to sleep some&nbsp;more.</p>

<h2>Second&nbsp;Wind</h2>
<p>At 9:30 I awoke again, the quarter pounder at 5am having subsided my
terrible hunger. The Japanese hotel bathrooms are supposedly very
standardized, with the automatic toilet bidet and shower. I have
learned to use these and, while it is not as familiar or satisfying as
the Arabian &#8216;shafata&#8217;, it is just as effective. I am pleased with it,
and it&#8217;s certainly better than just toilet paper. Europeans are
clearly missing&nbsp;this.</p>
<img alt="/static/images/DSC_0129.jpg" src="/static/images/DSC_0129.jpg" />
<p>The mechanized Japanese&nbsp;bidet.</p>
<p>David and I proceeded to the go camp registration location, to find
the Go camp staff, of whom was Jon, a PhD computer science English
speaker, perfect! What luck. We spoke to him, registered with Li Ting,
and met with Ryo Maeda 6P. They were all very kind, and gave us a gift
fan with our registration papers, to get signed by our favorite
professional players from the Kiin. I hope I can get Go Seigen&#8217;s in Tokyo&nbsp;somehow.</p>

<p>The Go arena, formerly a Sumo&nbsp;arena.</p>
<img alt="/static/images/DSC_0143.jpg" src="/static/images/DSC_0143.jpg" />
<p>With everything set up, I can&#8217;t wait to&nbsp;play.</p>
<p>I was a little disappointed with the quality of equipment, specifically the
thin stones. Even UPenn&#8217;s Go Society has better quality stones, and the boards
all seem to be foldable ones. Somebody must not enjoy moving this stuff&nbsp;around.</p>
<p>We took a mesh go board and plastic stones back to the hotel which
they provided, and proceeded to find food for brunch. This brought us
to a cafe serving charcoal roasted coffee, which David wanted to
try. I had an egg sandwich and iced coffee with coffee jelly, the
latter of which was very&nbsp;good.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="subway">
<h2>Subway</h2>
<p>The subways here are quite fascinating. You figure out your fare on a
map at your source and buy a ticket for that much, then you use your
ticket to go through the entrance gates, as well as the exit gates at your
destination. If you are switching lines and need to buy a new ticket,
you put them both in together at the gates in between!&nbsp;Epic.</p>
<img alt="/static/images/DSC_0148.jpg" src="/static/images/DSC_0148.jpg" />
<p>A complicated railway, and just the local parts&nbsp;too!</p>
<img alt="/static/images/DSC_0133.jpg" src="/static/images/DSC_0133.jpg" />
<p>The subway gates, they work both&nbsp;ways.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-perfect-shot">
<h2>The perfect&nbsp;shot</h2>
<p>David&#8217;s sister gave him a doll to take pictures of. In an attempt to
get an interesting shot, I tried to jump over two meters of water and,
to my dismay, failed and got my shoes all wet. Oh&nbsp;well.</p>
<img alt="/static/images/DSC_0161.jpg" src="/static/images/DSC_0161.jpg" />
<p>The little doll in the middle of the&nbsp;steps.</p>
<p>To remedy this, I decide to go find my hiking shoes now, since many
train stations in Japan are equipped with shopping
malls. Unfortunately, after 7 floors of woman&#8217;s wear, I discovered that
my feet were too big for Japan too. Let&#8217;s hope I&#8217;ll be able to find said
shoes before Mt.&nbsp;Fuji.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="extras">
<h2>Extras</h2>
<p>A woman plays <span class="caps">3DS</span> riding up the&nbsp;escalator.</p>
<p>Looking at more shoes, they are playing a daft punk get lucky
remix. I&#8217;ve noticed that two things so far are universal throughout
cultures: music, and&nbsp;numbers.</p>
<div class="section" id="never-a-dull-moment">
<h3>Never a dull&nbsp;moment</h3>
<p>Even when at a cafe for an innocent snack and
coffee, which serves toast, pronounced &#8216;toast-o&#8217; by the way, there are long
stretches of tables with complementary iPad minis to use. Also,
libraries filled with manga to borrow while you drink your
coffee. Growing up here would have been&nbsp;fun.</p>

<div class="section" id="first-game">
<h2>First&nbsp;game</h2>
<p>I play my first friendly game against Jon, one of the
supervisors. He&#8217;s a 3 Dan so even nine stones would not have been enough. He
decides we should play with six, as he is not a fan of white&#8217;s play in
high-handicap games. I acquiesce, relishing the opportunity to finally
play; I had been itching to all&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>Our game begins normally, but, as in any game with as many stones,
fighting begins quickly as white tries to take back the advantage. He
has me running from the corner, although I could have made life, but I
kept his two groups apart. A ladder he misread in the middle
strengthens my position tremendously. At this moment, we are fighting
for the group at the top left. I should be counting as he helps
incoming travelers to their&nbsp;rooms.</p>
<img alt="/static/images/IMG_1519.jpg" src="/static/images/IMG_1519.jpg" />
<p>The paused game state while I wait for Jon to&nbsp;return.</p>
<p>Thirty minutes later, he returned. And I&nbsp;lost.</p>

<p>A few moves before I&nbsp;resign.</p>
